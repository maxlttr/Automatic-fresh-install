Built to automatically configure a new installation from all my github dotfiles and scripts

## AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION AND UPDATE (arch)
<div/>

⚠️ You will be prompted during the install in case you don't want to overwirte a certain config file (polybar, rofi, qtile, tlp, sxhkd).

- Download the [installer](https://github.com/maxlttr/wm/blob/main/installer.sh) , make it executable and run it:

(Directly copy and paste all the following commands in your terminal)
```sh
cd ~/
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxlttr/wm/main/installer.sh
chmod +x installer.sh
./installer.sh
```
